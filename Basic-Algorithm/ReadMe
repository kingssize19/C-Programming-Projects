example 1 : 
Write a C program to compute the sum of the two input values. If the two values are the same, then return triple their sum.

example 2: 
Write a C program that will take a number as input and find the absolute difference between the input number and 51.
If the input number is greater than 51, it will return triple the absolute difference.

example 3: 
Write a C program that checks two given integers and returns true if at least one of them is 30 or if their sum is 30. 
In other words, if either of the two integers is 30 or if their sum equals 30, the program will return true.

example 4:
Write a C program that checks if a positive integer is divisible by either 3 or 7, or both. If the integer is a multiple of 3, then the program will return true. 
Similarly, if the integer is a multiple of 7, then also the program will return true. If the integer is not a multiple of 3 or 7, then the program will return false.
